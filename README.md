### Hi there 👋, I am Zaynul Abedin Miah


"𝗪𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗱𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴"

First-year computer science student, future web developer/software developer in database administration and web designs. My passion for web designing and programming brought me to Brac University where I am working on my bachelor's degree.

Currently, I am learning python programming and practising it by solving different types of tasks we face on our daily lives. And I have also joined computers club of brac university on communication and marketing department as a general member to learn activities outside of work.

Previously I've learnt html and css and built websites on freecodecamp. If you catch me outside work I play cricket. I love to help people and interact and communicate with them. I believe if you have better understanding and communication with people than you will be comfortable to work anywhere in the world.

Skills: Python / HTML / CSS / C++

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Youthbee organisation as Social Media Manager 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Problem solving with Python 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on github
